  <div class="AboutSetup">
    <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
      <p>I officially started my coding journey on <strong>June 5th, 2021.</strong> I had started, and stopped, twice before but this time I was really motivated! I was ready to change my 
        career and learn a new skill. I primarily used Codecademy, but I also used YouTube to help me understand the more complex concepts.</p>
      <p>To help me stay focused and accountable I set a goal and kept a daily journal of my progress. My goal was to achieve 1% progress in Codecademy’s Full-Stack Engineer Pro course per 
        day, aiming for a 100% in 100 days of lessons. The goal wasn’t to do it in 100 consecutive days, however. I made sure to take the appropriate time to work on my portfolio, projects 
        and include down time. I took one day off per week and I gave myself a full month between the Front-End and Back-End lessons to help solidify what I had been learning.</p>
      <p>My goal timeline was to complete the Front-End section in June and July, then take August to build my portfolio and complete some projects. Then complete the Back-End section, 
        thereby completing the Full-Stack program, in September and October. My Codecademy journey would then end on Halloween but my coding journey would have only just begun!</p>

        <p>This is my coding journal!</p>

    <h2>Coding Journal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <u>Day 1: Saturday, June 5</u> <br>
          Today I start, again, for the 3rd time. I reset all my progress on Codecademy, restarted my subscription, then began the Full-Stack Engineer (Pro) curriculum. After a couple 
          of hours of lessons, I took a walk with my wife, who is also starting today. We walked for about 30 mins, we talked mostly about our goals and the future coding could enable. 
          Working remotely, working a side hustle, Barista FIRE-ing, etc. We're both very excited, very motivated, ready to change our lives with our own efforts. I did an hour later 
          that evening, totaling 3 hours for my first day. <br> 
          <em>(3 hrs - 3 hrs Total) (2% Complete - Goal 1%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 2: Sunday, June 6</u> <br>
          I started today with two assignments, one was a Rock, Paper, Scissors assignment. Both assignments took an hour combined to complete. After a short break, I completed another hour, 
          then took an extended break. I felt motivated to organize my thoughts and goals so I put my goals and plan into writing before finishing the day with 30 more minutes of 
          Codecademy. I also wound down the last 30 minutes of the day with the introduction and first chapter from the book HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett. <br>
          <em>(3 hrs - 6 hrs Total) (4% Complete - Goal 2%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 3: Monday, June 7</u> <br>
          I managed to get about two hours of Codecademy lessons during the workday, mostly practice assignments. After dinner, I helped my wife through some of her lessons for about 
          half an hour then completed another hour of my lessons. Later I read Chapter 4 of JavaScript and JQuery by Jon Duckett as instructed by Codecademy before bed. <br>
          <em>(3.5 hrs - 9.5 hrs Total) (5% Complete - Goal 3%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day OFF: Tuesday, June 8</u> <br> Tuesdays are Off Days. However, I chose to read Chapter 3 of JavaScript and JQuery by Jon Duckett and watch a 2hr lecture on Youtube 
          from the Codecademy curriculum. Both the lecture and chapter took 2hrs, meaning I managed 4 total hours on a day I planned to do nothing. <br> 
          <em>(4 hrs - 13.5 hrs Total) (5% Complete - Goal 3%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 4: Wednesday, June 9</u> <br> I was feeling anxious about my progress (I felt like I was already slowing down despite being ahead of my goal), so I scheduled 3.5hrs 
          and more or less hit that target. I did have to help my wife troubleshoot Codecademy not staying connected for her as well as helping her with a few lessons, both of which 
          took some time. After the lessons, I read Chapter 2 of JavaScript and JQuery by Jon Duckett in bed. <br> <em>(3.5 hrs - 17 hrs Total) (7% Complete - Goal 4%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 5: Thursday, June 10</u> <br> I blocked out another long night. I gave myself 5 hours but also gave myself longer breaks (as I was struggling with the lessons 
          towards the end of the previous night). No bedtime reading this time, I instead did practice quizzes on Codecademy Go, the mobile companion app. <br> 
          <em>(3.5 hrs - 20.5 hrs Total) (9% Complete - Goal 5%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 6: Friday, June 11</u> <br> I watched two videos about higher-order functions to try to shore up my understanding of them. They didn't super help but they didn't 
          hurt either. I spent most of my evening setting up my notes for the rest of the journey so that all I had to do was update each preset day, making this part of the process 
          much easier. I also read the sections on functions and objects in JavaScript and JQuery by Jon Duckett in bed along with a couple of Codecademy Go quizzes. <br> 
          <em>(1.5 hrs - 22 hrs Total) (9% Complete - Goal 6%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 7: Saturday, June 12</u> <br> I spent about 2.5 hours total today working through Codecademy, working mostly on understanding how to read and fix error messages. 
          After the first hour and a half, I took an extended break then came back to do another hour of coding challenges before bed. <br> 
          <em>(2.5 hrs - 24.5 hrs Total) (10% Complete - Goal 7%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 8: Sunday, June 13</u> <br> I asked my web dev friend for help with understanding how to read and write higher-order functions then repeated a few lessons and 
          practices on CC. I spent around 4 hours total working on coding but only about an hour on new lessons. After that hour or so of new lessons, I decided to catch up on the 
          reading assignments, which took about an hour as well <br> <em>(5 hrs - 29.5 hrs Total) (11% Complete - Goal 8%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day OFF: Monday, June 14</u> <br> We did date night early this week. I made very little progress and enjoyed the night off. <br> 
          <em>(29.5 hrs Total) (11% Complete - Goal 8%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 9: Tuesday, June 15</u> <br> Tuesdays are off days normally but this week I decided to take Monday night off instead. When I logged in today I had lost 3%! Back 
          down to 8% Completed! Codecademy had fixed a bug that was counting progress incorrectly. I was determined to stay ahead of my goal so I blocked out 5 hours, breaking only to 
          shower then getting right back to it. <br> <em>(4.5 hrs - 34 hrs Total) (11% Complete - Goal 9%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 10: Wednesday, June 16</u> <br> Tonight was all about getting comfortable with creating repositories and committing code to GitHub. Towards the end of the evening, 
          I was given a random message generator project that helped reinforce the use of GitHub. I spent about 3.5 hours in total. I re-read the introduction and first chapter of the 
          HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett again, as directed by Codecademy to prepare for tomorrow's lessons. <br> 
          <em>(3.5 hrs - 37.5 hrs Total) (13% Complete - Goal 10%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 11: Thursday, June 17</u> <br> I had every intention of working through courses today but legitimately ran out of time before I had the chance. Immediately after 
          work, I had an appointment at a dealership that lasted well into the evening. By the time I got home, it was already later than my usual bedtime. I spent 30 mins reading in 
          bed, then passed out. <br> <em>(0.5 hrs - 38 hrs Total) (13% Complete - Goal 11%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 12: Friday, June 18</u> <br> Back at it. I was exhausted from a terrible night of sleep but I powered through as best as I could. I put in an hour and decided I would 
          be better served to continue tomorrow after sleeping in. <br> <em>(1 hrs - 39 hrs Total) (13% Complete - Goal 12%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 13: Saturday, June 19</u> <br> I got a bit of a late start today. I started with an hour, got through a lesson then stopped for dinner. After an extended break I only 
          had enough time to do another half an hour before bed. <br> <em>(1.5 hrs - 40.5 hrs Total) (14% Complete - Goal 13%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 14: Sunday, June 20</u> <br> Another day, another set of lessons. I started about mid-afternoon, did an hour, then took a shower break. I had a really hard time 
          concentrating, I spent about two more hours on lessons but probably only got about an hour of value out of it. So I called it early today. <br> 
          <em>(2 hrs - 42.5 hrs Total) (15% Complete - Goal 14%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day OFF: Monday, June 21</u> <br> We did date night early again this week. I made very little progress and enjoyed the night off. <br> 
          <em>(42.5 hrs Total) (15% Complete - Goal 14%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 15: Tuesday, June 22</u> <br> I started at 5 pm, went until 6:30 pm then took an extended break. I sat back down at 8 pm and did lessons until 9 pm. I finished up 
          the day with 2.5 more hours in the books! <br> <em>(2.5 hrs - 45 hrs Total) (16% Complete - Goal 15%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 16: Wednesday, June 23</u> <br> Today was my first day back in the office so my free time will start dropping, but I will do my best to not let that slow me down! 
          Having said that, I started at 7 pm and went until 8 pm. After a 30 min break, I did one more hour. <br> <em>(2 hrs - 47 hrs Total) (18% Complete - Goal 16%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 17: Thursday, June 24</u> <br> Due to a family event, I started later than I wanted, but still made progress! I started at 730 pm and went for an hour. I was pretty 
          tired so I read the latest assigned chapter in HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett and went to bed. <br> 
          <em>(1.5 hrs - 48.5 hrs Total) (19% Complete - Goal 17%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 18: Friday, June 25</u> <br> Another late start, returning to the office is killing me! I started at 8 pm and went until 10 pm! I spent about half of that time 
          trying to get my portfolio page live. I was having issues getting my progress updated on GitHub, after a few google searches I got it all set up and ready to go! However, 
          this means I didn’t make a lot of progress in Codecademy. <br> <em>(1 hrs - 49.5 hrs Total) (19% Complete - Goal 18%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 19: Saturday, June 26</u> <br> Started at 6 pm today, went until 7 pm then stopped for a late dinner. I started back up again at 9:30 pm. I completed a project and 
          a series of CSS coding challenges. I worked until bedtime at 10:30 pm. <br> <em>(2 hrs - 51.5 hrs Total) (20% Complete - Goal 19%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 20: Sunday, June 27</u> <br> Before starting Codecademy courses today I spent some time working on my portfolio web page ahead of the assignment. I was getting 
          excited and knew I was really just some boilerplate and a git push away from having something on the internet! While I was working on setting up my webpage I also watched 
          HTML and CSS Lecture 0 CS50 on YouTube, I had heard good things and wanted to see for myself. I started doing CC lessons at 3:30 pm and went for an hour. I went back to 
          tinkering with my personal website for a bit before taking an extended break. I logged back into Codecademy again at 8 pm and went for another hour. <br> 
          <em>(2 hrs - 53.5 hrs Total) (22% Complete - Goal 20%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 21: Monday, June 28</u> <br> Back to the office, this is just life now (again)! I watched another two CS50 lectures during downtime while at the office. Later that 
          evening I started coding lessons at 7:30 pm and went for an hour. I took a 30 min break and got back to it at 9 pm, for another hour! <br> 
          <em>(2 hrs - 55.5 hrs Total) (23% Complete - Goal 21%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day OFF: Tuesday, June 29</u> <br> Tuesdays are Off Days. <br> <em>(55.5 hrs Total) (23% Complete - Goal 21%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 22: Wednesday, June 30</u> <br> Another 7 pm start, another hour in the books! I took a shower as a break and sat back down for another hour. I was a little behind 
          on the reading assignments so I also spent the last half hour of my day catching up (JavaScript and JQuery by Jon Duckett), totaling 2.5 hrs for the day. <br> 
          <em>(2.5 hrs - 58 hrs Total) (25% Complete - Goal 22%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 23: Thursday, July 1</u> <br> Another day, another set of lessons! I sat down at 7:30 pm today and went for an hour, but I noticed I wasn’t fully engaging with the 
          lessons. I was actually really struggling to stay focused, so I called it early. <br> 
          <em>(1 hrs - 59 hrs Total) (25% Complete - Goal 23%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 24: Friday, July 2</u> <br> I had to work a little later today, I also needed to grab stationery specifically for wireframing, so I got a late start. I sat down at 
          8:30 pm and did CC lessons for an hour, stopping to shower. At 10:00 pm I sat back down to hammer out 30 more minutes of lessons, then I went to bed! <br> 
          <em>(1.5 hrs - 60.5 hrs Total) (27% Complete - Goal 24%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 25: Saturday, July 3</u> <br> Long weekend! Time to get those CC gains! I sat down today at 7:30 pm and went for an hour. After a 30 min break I got back to it for 
          another hour! 9 pm to 10 pm, then I called it for the day. <br> <em>(2 hrs - 62.5 hrs Total) (29% Complete - Goal 25%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 26: Sunday, July 4</u> <br> Time to celebrate the 4th of July by doing Codecademy lessons! I only blocked out an hour for lessons today. I knew an hour would put me 
          at the portfolio website project and I wanted to dedicate, more or less, an entire day to start it. Luckily for me, I have tomorrow off, that’s when I’ll start! <br> 
          <em>(1 hrs - 63.5 hrs Total) (30% Complete - Goal 26%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 27: Monday, July 5 (ONE MONTH!)</u> <br> Portfolio website day! Since I have the day off I figured I would spend it working on my portfolio page! Very little Codecademy 
          progress to report today but I was definitely busy most of the day! <br> <em>(0.5 hrs - 64 hrs Total) (30% Complete - Goal 27%)</em> </li>
          
        <li> <u>Day OFF: Tuesday, July 6</u> <br> Tuesdays are Off Days. <br> <em>(64 hrs Total) (30% Complete - Goal 27%)</em> </li>
        
        <li> <u>Day 28: Wednesday, July 7</u> <br> I felt like I had taken an extended break but I only took one day to work on my website and one actual day off. Either way, 
          I was ready to get back to it! I started at 6:30 pm and went for an hour then took a shower break. I sat back down at 8:00 pm and went for another hour and a half. I really 
          struggled to stay focused, I spent a lot of time reading and rereading the lessons. I knew I was making great progress and had built up a ton of momentum and I really wanted to 
          keep it going, so I powered through! <br> <em>(2.5 hrs - 66.5 hrs Total) (32% Complete - Goal 28%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 29: Thursday, July 8</u> <br> Let's get it! Sat down at 7 pm, went for an hour. I took a walk to the convenience store near my apartment and got ready for another hour. 
          I sat back down, snacks in hand, at 8:30 pm and went for an hour and a half! <br> <em>(2.5 hrs - 69 hrs Total) (35% Complete - Goal 29%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 30: Friday, July 9</u> <br> I sat down a little later than usual, kinda tired but ready to learn! I started at 7:30 pm and went for an hour. After taking a break I was 
          feeling really tired, work was particularly draining today (getting my office ready to reopen, post-pandemic!) so I called it early. <br> 
          <em>(1 hrs - 70 hrs Total) (36% Complete - Goal 30%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 31: Saturday, July 10</u> <br> I had an appointment early so I started a bit later than I was hoping to. Today I started at noon and went for an hour. After which I took 
          a short break, and got back to it at 1:30 pm for another hour. I had another appointment in the mid~late afternoon so I stopped there for the day. <br> 
          <em>(2 hrs - 72 hrs Total) (37% Complete - Goal 31%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 32: Sunday, July 11</u> <br> I spent about an hour working on my portfolio website, I made my contact page operational and removed the JS alert saying it was down. I 
          started my first hour of Codecademy lessons at 7 pm, I went until 8 pm then took a short break. I sat back down at 8:30 pm and went for another hour. <br> 
          <em>(2 hrs - 74 hrs Total) (38% Complete - Goal 32%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 33: Monday, July 12</u> <br> Time to code! I sat down at 7 pm, fired up the ol’ Codecademy, and went for an hour! After a 30 min break, I got back to it. This time from 
          8:30 pm to 9:30 pm! Today was all about post and get requests and working with APIs. I also finally started the React lessons! <br> 
          <em>(2 hrs - 76 hrs Total) (41% Complete - Goal 33%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day OFF: Tuesday, July 13</u> <br> Tuesdays are Off Days. <br> <em>(76 hrs Total) (41% Complete - Goal 33%)</em> </li>

        <li><u>Day 34: Wednesday, July 14</u> <br> React! Finally! I started a little late, I sat down at 7:30 pm and went for an hour and a half. I was very excited to keep going but my 
        allergies and post-work exhaustion were too much. I can’t wait for tomorrow! <br> <em>(1.5 hrs - 77.5 hrs Total) (41% Complete - Goal 34%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 35: Thursday, July 15</u> <br> Time for more React! I knew I only had an hour tonight so I made sure to really focus. I started at 5:45 and went until 6:45, then had to 
        leave. <br> <em>(1 hrs - 78.5 hrs Total) (42% Complete - Goal 35%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 36: Friday, July 16</u> <br> Today I started at 10:30 AM! Yup, AM! My employer gave the company the day off. I went for an hour and a half then took a break for lunch! 
          The first session covered creating web apps with React and learning how to import and export functionality between them. I also learned how to use and manipulate component props 
          and states. I sat back down at 3:30 pm and went for an hour, then took another break. 8 PM, time for another hour, and then I called it for the day! <br> 
          <em>(3.5 hrs - 82 hrs Total) (44% Complete - Goal 36%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 37: Saturday, July 17</u> <br> I started today at 3:30 PM, today’s first lesson was on the lifecycle of a React class component. I took an extended break at 4:30 PM to run 
          errands. I sat back down after dinner at 7:30 PM and went for another hour. The second hour was mostly lessons about functional React components and hooks. So much nicer than 
          writing classes! <br> <em>(2 hrs - 84 hrs Total) (45% Complete - Goal 37%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 38: Sunday, July 18</u> <br> Today was a continuation of function components in React. My first hour, started at 7 PM, covered state setters and setting from previous 
          states. At 8 PM I took a break. I was really struggling to understand what I was being taught, I felt like maybe seeing it in video form might help. So, I stopped at an hour of 
          Codecademy lessons for the day and spent the rest of the evening watching React JS tutorials on youtube. <br> <em>(1 hrs - 85 hrs Total) (45% Complete - Goal 38%)</em> </li>
                
        <li> <u>Day 39: Monday, July 19</u> <br> During the workday, I squeezed a couple React tutorial videos in, I’m starting to feel better about it. I started Codecademy lessons tonight 
          at 7:30 PM, I learned about useEffects, primarily, and how to use CSS in React. After an hour and a half, I stopped for the evening. I stopped a little early to watch more React 
          tutorials on YouTube. <br> <em>(1.5 hrs - 86.5 hrs Total) (46% Complete - Goal 39%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day OFF: Tuesday, July 20</u> <br> Tuesdays are Off Days. <br> <em>(46% Complete - Goal 39%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 40: Wednesday, July 21</u> <br> Back at it! I started at 7 PM and took a break at 8 PM. Tonight’s first lesson was all about separating container and presentational 
          components, organization and readability were the themes! The second lesson was about propTypes; validation and documentation! The final lesson covered in the first hour was on 
          creating forms with React. At 8:30 PM I sat back down for another half hour, completing lessons until 9:00 PM. The second session was an introduction to Redux! 
          <br> <em>(1.5 hrs - 88 hrs Total) (48% Complete - Goal 40%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 41: Thursday, July 22</u> <br> I started at 7:30 PM tonight for my first hour, by 8:30 PM I had learned about states, actions, reducers, pure functions, and how to store 
          data in Redux. After a shower break, I sat back down at 9 PM and went for another hour, I learned about a dedicated Redux library and API! I wrapped up at 10 PM for the night!

        <li> <u>Day 42: Friday, July 23</u> <br> When I got home from work I was feeling rundown and exhausted, but I powered through a couple of tutorials I saved for later on YouTube. I 
          spent about an hour and a half watching tutorials and recaps and ultimately didn’t make any progress on Codecademy.

        <li> <u>Day 43: Saturday, July 24</u> <br> I started my first hour at 2:45 PM today, in that first hour I learned about action creators, store/store.dispatch, and event listeners in 
          Redux. I took a break then started my second hour at 4:30 PM. I learned about slices in Redux, completed a quiz, then a project where I finished setting up the cart for a fake 
          online store. <br> <em>(2 hrs - 92 hrs Total) (49% Complete - Goal 43%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 44: Sunday, July 25 (50% Completed!)</u> <br> I knew I had a couple back to back appointments and events later in the day so I got an early start. I sat down at 9:30 
          AM for my first hour. I had a chance a little bit later to squeeze in a second hour starting at 12:15 PM. Today’s lessons covered the React-Redux library and tying the two together. 
          I also learned about the Redux Toolkit and played around with some of the functionality it has. <br> <em>(2 hrs - 94 hrs Total) (51% Complete - Goal 44%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 45: Monday, July 26</u> <br> I started at 7:30 PM, went for an hour then took a 30 min break. I started my second hour at 9 PM. Tonight I finished up the Redux lessons 
          with testing in Redux and general Redux review. The next set of lessons was a return to git, I learned how to handle creating, deleting, and moving into branches as well as dealing 
          with merge conflicts. After that I learned about cloning, fetching, and pushing with git! This marked the end of the Front-End section of the Full-Stack program! 
          <br> <em>(2 hrs - 96 hrs Total) (54% Complete - Goal 45%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day OFF: Tuesday, July 27</u> <br> Tuesdays are Off Days. <br> <em>(54% Complete - Goal 45%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 46: Wednesday, July 28</u> <br> I started at 7:30 PM and went for an hour, took a 30 minute break, then did another hour starting at 9 PM. Having now completed all the 
          Front-End lessons in the Full-Stack program I pivoted to completing all the incomplete and accessory Front-End specific courses. The first one I tackled was the last little bit of 
          the dedicated Javascript course. The last lesson in that course was on babel and caniuse.com. Next I finished off the Build a Website and Intermediate CSS programs, which covered 
          CSS transitions and variables. <br> <em>(2 hrs - 98 hrs Total) (54% Complete - Goal 46%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 47: Thursday, July 29 (100 Hours!)</u> <br> I started my first hour tonight at 7:30 PM again. I continued to finish off the Front-End specific courses that the main 
          program didn’t quite complete. The first hour covered web accessibility, readability, and color. I also completed a couple React lessons and quizzes before the hour was up. After 
          a short break I sat back down for another hour at 9 PM, this time learning about navigation design and color design. 
          <br> <em>(2 hrs - 100 hrs Total) (54% Complete - Goal 47%)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Day 48: Friday, July 30</u> <br> I started tonight at 7 PM, and went for an hour. In my first hour I learned about Bootstrap! After a shower break I sat back down for another 
          hour at 8:30 PM and learned about Sass! <br> <em>(2 hrs - 102 hrs Total) (54% Complete - Goal 48%)</em> </li>
                
        <li> <u>Day 49: Saturday, July 31</u> <br> Final day of Front-End lessons! I started at 7 PM and took a break at 8 PM. In the first hour I finished off the Sass course and moved on 
          to finish off the Front-End specific courses. I sat back down at 8:30 PM and went for another hour. As I was going through the last of the Front-End courses I noticed there were 
          some courses that were at the end of the Full-Stack version I’ve been doing. I decided to save those for when I reached them in my Full-Stack curriculum.
