    <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
      <p>I officially started my coding journey on <strong>June 5th, 2021.</strong> I had started, and stopped, twice before but this time I was really 
      motivated! I was ready to change my career and learn a new skill. I primarily used Codecademy, but I also used YouTube to help me understand the
      more complex concepts. To help me stay focused and accountable I set a goal and kept a daily journal of my progress. My goal was to get to 100%
      completion in the Full-Stack Developer course on Codecademy in 100 days (excluding Tuesdays which was the only night I took off every week). 
      Iâ€™ve included that journal here!</p>

        <li>Day 1: Saturday, June 5 <br>
          Today I start, again, for the 3rd time. I reset all my progress on Codecademy, restarted my subscription, then began the Full-Stack Engineer 
          (Pro) curriculum. After a couple of hours of lessons, I took a walk with my wife, who is also starting today. We walked for about 30 mins, we 
          talked mostly about our goals and the future coding could enable. Working remotely, working a side hustle, Barista FIRE-ing, etc. We're both 
          very excited, very motivated, ready to change our lives with our own efforts. I did an hour later that evening, totaling 3 hours for my first 
          day. <br> (3 hrs - 3 hrs Total) (2% Complete - Goal 1%)</li>
