    <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
      <p>I officially started my coding journey on <b>June 5th, 2021.</b> I had started, and stopped, twice before but this time I was committed! I was ready to change my career and 
        learn a new skill. I started out using Codecademy and YouTube, about 16 weeks in I decided to sign up for a coding boot camp, Fullstack Academy, hosted through the University of Texas 
        at Dallas.</p>

      <p>To help me stay focused and accountable, before the boot camp, I set a goal and kept a daily journal of my progress. My goal was to complete the Full Stack Developer course on 
        Codecademy. Starting with the Front End Developer section, pausing my progress to build out my portfolio, then resuming the Back End section while searching for a Front End Developer 
        position. I didn’t ultimately stick to this original plan, as halfway through it I decided to sign up for a boot camp.</p>

      <p>I started my journey with a strict timeline to follow but adjusted and shifted the goalposts as I figured out what worked and what didn’t. Through it all, I never lost sight of the 
        ultimate goal: Developing and honing the necessary skills for a career change. </p>

        <p>This is my coding journal!</p>

    <h2>Coding Journal</h2>

        <li> <u>Week 0: Saturday, June 5 - Sunday, June 6</u> <br> 
          I started by first resetting all my previous progress on Codecademy, then subscribing to the Fullstack Engineer Pro course. The first two days, and my first “week”, I was excited 
          and probably overdid it a bit. I spent 3 hours both days, I learned the basics of JavaScript and I spent time reading the first chapters in the two Jon Duckett books my curriculum 
          recommended. (HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites - JavaScript and JQuery) <br> 
          <em>(6 hrs Total) (4% Completed the Fullstack Developer course)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Week 1: Monday, June 7 - Sunday, June 13</u> <br> 
          My first full week. I spent over 3 hours per day between Codecademy, reading the textbooks, and watching youtube. I struggled with higher-order functions, so I slowed down a bit to 
          research them more. I turned to YouTube and a friend in the industry for help. I was also introduced to the art of understanding error messages and started doing daily knowledge 
          checks with the CodecademyGo mobile app. <br> 
          <em>(29.5 hrs Total) (11% Completed the Fullstack Developer course)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Week 2: Monday, June 14 - Sunday, June 2</u> <br> 
          The first thing I learned about this week was git, what it is and how to use GitHub. After git the course returned to JavaScript. All in all, I had a rough week, I was unproductive 
          and unfocused. I had a stressful life event that made the week challenging, but I powered through as best as I could. I found myself making more progress in the textbooks than the 
          actual Codecademy course. <br> 
          <em>(42.5 hrs Total) (15% Completed the Fullstack Developer course)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Week 3: Monday, June 21 - Sunday, June 27</u> <br> 
          This week saw me return to the office. I was previously working from home but my office decided to reopen. I was determined to slow down as little as possible though. While at the 
          office I was able to read a few chapters of my textbook and watch the CS50 Lecture Series on YouTube. By Sunday I had learned enough HTML and CSS to get a basic portfolio page up, 
          and hosted it on GitHub Pages. I was very happy with the progress I had made in the course and with already having something to show for my efforts. <br> 
          <em>(53.5 hrs Total) (22% Completed the Fullstack Developer course)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Week 4: Monday, June 28 - Sunday, July 4</u> <br> 
          This week was largely uneventful, just more HTML and CSS courses. I’m done with JavaScript for a bit, having completed the fundamentals. By the end of the week I had reached the 
          Create A Portfolio Page section of the curriculum, which I was already ahead of. I set myself up to be able to take full advantage of the long weekend, and read chapters in the 
          textbooks to round out the week. <br> 
          <em>(63.5 hrs Total) (30% Completed the Fullstack Developer course)</em> </li>
                
        <li> <u>Week 5: Monday, July 5 - Sunday, July 11</u> <br> 
          I took advantage of the long weekend to finish setting up my basic portfolio website. I even figured out how to add a contact me page without any JavaScript. This week was largely 
          about keeping the momentum going. Work was definitely taking my energy out of me but I wasn’t about to let anything stop me! <br> 
          <em>(74 hrs Total) (38% Completed the Fullstack Developer course)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Week 6: Monday, July 12 - Sunday, July 18</u> <br> 
          I started the week off working with APIs in vanilla JavaScript and then moved on to React. I learned about React states, components, props, and the lifecycle. I learned about 
          manipulating the DOM and how to create a React app locally. This week was all about working with classes, but towards the end of the week, I started to learn about hooks. <br> 
          <em>(85 hrs Total) (45% Completed the Fullstack Developer course)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Week 7: Monday, July 19 - Sunday, July 25</u> <br> 
          This week covered useState, useEffect, useRef, and embedding CSS in JSX. I then learned about properly separating components and importing and exporting them accordingly. The second 
          half of the week briefly covered Redux. I learned about states, actions, reducers, pure functions, and storing data in Redux. <br> 
          <em>(94 hrs Total) (51% Completed the Fullstack Developer course)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Week 8: Monday, July 26 - Sunday, August 1</u> <br> 
          The week started off with finishing up the Redux lessons. I learned about testing in Redux then moved back to using git. This time I learned about creating and deleting branches in 
          git and how to handle merge conflicts. At this point I was through the Front-End section of the curriculum so I took this time to finish up every other Front-End related course I 
          could on Codecademy. I covered the Sass, intermediate CSS, Responsive Design, Bootstrap, and Navigation Design courses. At this point in my journey I felt it would be a good idea to 
          create a couple web apps in React for my projects page in my portfolio. <br> 
          <em>(104 hrs Total) (56% Completed the Fullstack Developer course)</em> </li>

        <li> <u>Week 9: Monday, August 2 - Sunday, August 8</u> <br> 
          I started the week by taking a couple days to myself. I didn’t make any progress, I just relaxed. The first thing I did was make a list of the React projects I wanted to attempt. I 
          wanted to start off easy and ramp up so I planned on starting with a To-Do List app and a Tic-Tac-Toe app. Then from there, I would create a Stock/Crypto Tracker and a Yelp! app that 
          helps you find nearby, highly reviewed, restaurants. Now that I had my list I was ready to start my first React app! I spent some time setting up my first React environment and 
          prepared for the week ahead. </li>

        <li> <u>Week 10: Monday, August 9 - Sunday, August 15</u> <br> 
          I’m not going to lie, my first attempt was miserable and disheartening. I realized almost right away that I was in way over my head. All I was trying to do was a simple To-Do List 
          app and I struggled with the basics. I watched a few tutorials and code along and felt more lost and frustrated afterward. I decided to slow down, back up a bit, and try again. I 
          came up with a game plan to retread some ground, revisit some Codecademy lessons, then try again. By the end of the week, I had made a Blackjack app in vanilla JS and added it to 
          my portfolio page (check it out!). Although it was a code-along project I was able to add features, such as an “AI” opponent, and various other small changes. It was exactly the 
          confidence builder I needed! </li>

        <li> <u>Week 11: Monday, August 16 - Sunday, August 22</u> <br> 
          My goal isn’t to work in vanilla JS though, so now I needed to focus on React projects. At the start of the week, I laid out a list of tutorials to watch on YouTube, with a code 
          along with the project at the end. The same To-Do List app that was tripping me up earlier. I watched roughly 20 hours of tutorials, then completed the code-along. I added the link 
          to the app in my portfolio from my GitHub and called it a week. I definitely feel a little better, ready to take on a project from scratch again! </li>

        <li> <u>Week 12: Monday, August 23 - Sunday, August 29</u> <br> 
          I started the week off by tweaking the colors and responsiveness of my portfolio. I then attempted a tic-tac-toe project on my own. I once again found myself struggling with it, I 
          may have chosen a more intermediate assignment too quickly. So I decided to code along for it as well but this time I would make a couple of modifications to it. I tinkered with it 
          for a day after the code-along. I added a reset button and set it to automatically reset on meeting the win condition after a short delay. I also spent about two hours trying to 
          rebuild the to-do list app from scratch with a web developer friend, which I also found very challenging but ultimately was able to do. </li>

        <li> <u>Week 13: Monday, August 30 - Sunday, September 5</u> <br> 
          I spent the first half of the week finding more resources online to help me with React. I researched tutors and coding boot camps and ultimately ended up taking half the week off 
          from projects. I think I’ve realized that I’ve been watching too much, hoping to understand it, when I need to fight through practice instead. My goal for the next week is to do 
          just that.  </li>

        <li> <u>Week 14: Monday, September 6 - Sunday, September 12</u> <br> 
          My goal was to try again but instead, I spent the week researching boot camps. I got accepted by SMU and UTD here in Dallas, TX. Getting them to call me was surprisingly difficult, 
          comparing them was also difficult because the cost was the same and they both covered the same technologies. I ultimately decided these weren’t going to be a good fit, I need to slow 
          down and work at my pace, boot camps were going to be fast-paced. I felt comfort in knowing that if I couldn’t figure out how to progress I could always fall back on one. </li>

        <li> <u>Week 15: Monday, September 13 - Sunday, September 19</u> <br> 
          Ok so, back on track? I spent the week back on Codecademy. I redid the vanilla JS lessons and the React lessons. I may have gone through them too quickly the first time. My plan was 
          to slow down, make sure I understood everything I was seeing, and not dismiss anything. When I hit something I didn’t fully understand I made sure to supplement it with a YouTube 
          tutorial. I also revisited the textbooks, cover to cover. I’m not sure if this is what they call “tutorial hell” but it made me feel better prepared to try a React app again. I also 
          spent some time reformatting my blog for readability and to make my life easier.  </li>

        <li> <u>Week 16: Monday, September 20 - Sunday, September 26</u> <br> 
          Back on track part 2. I wasn’t able to finish the React lessons (for the 2nd time) last week so I made sure to complete them, again, this week. I did all the same things as last week 
          but this time with React exclusively. I’m almost certain this is what “tutorial hell” is, but I planned on moving on to guided projects via YouTube and I wasn’t feeling quite ready 
          until now.  </li>
                
        <li> <u>Week 17: Monday, September 27- Sunday, October 3</u> <br> 
          I changed my mind! I revisited the Fullstack Academy boot camp curriculum and information. I applied for a loan, added it to my budget, and planned out what my weekly schedule might 
          look like. I really liked what I saw and I felt like I was properly prepared for it. So I signed up and created a new game plan. The boot camp starts November 16th so I have over a 
          month to make sure I’m as prepared as I possibly can be. My new plan is to complete the Back End portion, and therefore the rest of, the Full-stack Developer program on Codecademy 
          ahead of the boot camp start. </li>
